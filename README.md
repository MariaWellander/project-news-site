# News Site

The task was to create a classic magazine or newspaper site, using Flexbox and CSS Grid. The site also needed to be responsive, being user friendly from devices such as; mobile, tablet and desktop.

## The problem

Initially, I got inspired from a classsic news paper/tabloid. Then I wanted to have a not that stiff content and design to it, as a remember to myself that this isn't life nor death and that I'm doing this for fun to learn (it was fun!)

I planned my project by deciding on following the design sketch that we were offered. Then I decided on picking a name, colors, do the HTML, the CSS and then the README and deploying to Netlify.

For this project I used technologies such as;
Figma, Visual Studio Code, GitHub, Netlify, HTML and CSS.

If I had more time I would've wanted to spend more time on the styling and optimizing the media queries. Also would've been nice to create a styling that wasn't that childish. But hey, I'm not going to be the designer in the end.
